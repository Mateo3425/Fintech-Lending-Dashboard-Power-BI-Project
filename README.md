# Fintech-Lending-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project
This project features an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze loan issuance trends, customer segments, payment behavior, ROI, and default rates in a simulated fintech dataset. It includes key KPIs, dynamic filtering, and segment-level insights to support business decisions.

This project simulates a real-world fintech lending dataset and showcases how to extract insights through advanced visualizations and DAX calculations in Power BI. It helps stakeholders monitor loan activity, identify high-performing segments, track repayments, and evaluate risk through default rates.
